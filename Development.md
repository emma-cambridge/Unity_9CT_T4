## Identifying and Defining
### Identifying a Need
- Need: To improve children's fine motor skills and problem-solving ability in a relaxing and engaging game
- Problem Statement: Children need interesting ways to engage their critical thinking and hand-eye coordination. A rolling ball game is a fun, colourful way of developing these essential skills.
- Skill Development: To develop the necessary skills I'll follow this tutorial - https://learn.unity.com/project/roll-a-ball?uv=2019.4
### Requirements Outline
#### Functional Requirements
- Inputs: User inputs will be the arrow keys or wasd to direct the ball
- Processing: The program will update the score based on how many collectibles are collected and will check for collisions with the ball
- Outputs: The user will be able to see their score, the ball's position and the splash screen
- Transmission: Will not be required
- Storage: The game will store the user's highest score
- User Interaction: The user will be able to select start or quit using a mouse click and direct the ball using the arrow keys.
- Simulation mechanics: The game will aim to simulate the movement of a real ball in a maze with the visualisations and controls, allowing the player to navigate the simulation with relative ease
- Scoring and Feedback: The scoring system will be based on how many collectibles are gathered. The player will be able to retry the game to get a higher score
- Level progression: The levels will get gradually harder and be triggered by the completion of the maze
- Saving and Loading Data: The player's highest score will be saved locally on their computer
#### Non-Functional Requirements'
- Performance: The game should load in 4 seconds and respond to the user's inputs instantly
- Usability: The UI will be simple and intuitive with a splash screen upon entering the game and a good view of the puzzles, and will contain written instructions directing the user to which keys to press.
- Compatiility:
